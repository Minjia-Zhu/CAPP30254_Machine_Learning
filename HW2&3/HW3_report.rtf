I use random forest, extra tree, ada boost, logistic, SVM, gradient boost, decision tree and KNN classifier. 
And then use evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision at different levels, recall at different levels, 
F1, area under curve, and precision-recall curves to compare different model.
